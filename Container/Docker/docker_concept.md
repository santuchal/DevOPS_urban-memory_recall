# Docker

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.


- Why DOCKER?

    - An application is working fine on developer console but not in testing or in production.

    - In Dev there can be a software which is updated but in testing and production an older version is being used.

    - Docker is a computer program/tool that makes it easier to deploy and run applications using a concept known as “containerization”.

    - Imagine as a developer your application is packaged up with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and it is shipped out as one package

    - Docker in other words is a light weight virtualization tool and containerizing platform where you can run and deploy applications and its dependencies which can be run in a Linux environment.

    - Docker is an open-source project based on Linux containers. It uses Linux Kernel features like namespaces and control groups to create containers on top of an operating system.
